More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that 
prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Modern 
cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, 
computer science, information security, electrical engineering, digital signal 
processing, physics, and others.
