Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, 
converting readable information (plaintext) to unintelligible nonsense text 
(ciphertext), which can only be read by reversing the process (decryption). 
The sender of an encrypted (coded) message shares the decryption (decoding) 
technique only with intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. 
The cryptography literature often uses the names "Alice" (or "A") for the 
sender, "Bob" (or "B") for the intended recipient, and "Eve" (or "E") for the 
eavesdropping adversary. Extensive open academic research into cryptography is 
relatively recent, beginning in the mid-1970s.
