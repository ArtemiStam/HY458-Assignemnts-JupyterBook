# Welcome to HY458 Assignments book

This book contains the assignments of the previous years(2022-2023) and their solutions for the course <b>Introduction to cryptography(HY458)</b>. For every assignment you can find its solution in code blocks. The code blocks are automatically run at first but you can also use the <b>live code</b> feature by clicking at the rocket button located at the top right corner. This feature allows you to change the code(don't worry when you refresh the original code reappears) and run different code blocks. If you make any changes you need to re-run all code blocks.
